        Ipland brings together popular characters from well-known animations and
        games. Players will host their own island, and invite multiple
        characters to visit. They can interact with their favorite characters
        and try to ask them stay longer. It's a serene space where players can
        enjoy the tranquility of island life and the joy of friendship.

        <em>How to play:</em>
      </div>
      <p class="text-l text-zinc-500 mt-4">
        The player need to collect 4 types of resources to host the guests.
        After player has collected 10 apples, 4 coffee beans, 6 coconuts and 8
        firewoods, a random guest will be invited to visit the island. If the
        player want to invite more guests, more resources will be needed.
      </p>

        class="block relative mt-2 w-full bg-white rounded-xl overflow-hidden"

        />
      </a>

      <p class="text-l text-zinc-500 mt-6">
        The shop will display the amount of resources the player has already
        collected. The player can go to the shop and check how much more is
        needed to invite the next guest.
      </p>

        class="block relative mt-2 w-full bg-white rounded-xl overflow-hidden"

      <p class="text-l text-zinc-500 mt-6">
        When a guest visits, the player can start a conversation with them. The
        content of the conversations are generated by AI based on the
        character’s background stories and personality, making each dialog
        unique. After several talks, the player will have the opportunity to
        invite the guest to extend their stay on the island.
